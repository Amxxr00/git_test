    Justus, baron von Liebig (born May 12, 1803, Darmstadt, Hesse-Darmstadt
    [Germany]â€”died April 18, 1873, Munich, Bavaria) was a German chemist who
    made significant contributions to the analysis of organic compounds, the
    organization of laboratory-based chemistry education, and the application of
    chemistry to biology (biochemistry) and agriculture.

  <h1>what was his achievement?</h1>
  <p>
    One of his most recognized accomplishments is the development of
    nitrogen-based fertilizer. In the first two editions of his book (1840,
    1842), Liebig reported that the atmosphere contained insufficient nitrogen,
    and argued that nitrogen-based fertilizer was needed to grow the healthiest
    possible crops.
